Factorio:
- Universal tilable mining?
- Create construcition tree
- Create blueprint for total construction factory
	- different classes of needs
	- full output needed for feeding into the output of the total factory
	- leftover production for some items, not needed, not guaranteed to produce full line of output (are all of these to be fed into chests?)
	- build backwards? calc total number of needed raw material inputs
	- opt out of building some things entirely?
	- if the number of raw inputs is just overwhelming what then?
	- pu
- Tilable refining?

Mod ideas:
- autorouting
	- hook up designated belt with a marking device that signals the type of routing to do then bots lay down belts
- economy system
	- trade resources for currency
	- trade currency for offworld resources
	- create a ship port
	- create ship technology to improve fleet
	- can send ships on missions (similar to no man's sky)
	- customers/colonists
		- could help you do menial tasks (anything bots can't do?)
		- would give you currency for providing them services
			- hotel accomodations
			- entertainment
			- war
- other planets
- have to purchase land
- ai players
- city area on map generated
	- if you connect cities with trains you get rewards
	- supply cities with resources and they repay you
	- build army to attack cities
		- they might declare war on you, sending bots
	- 
- random discoveries
	- killing monsters or exploring other areas
	- drop/reveal special items
		- higher level speed module
		- suit upgrades
		- monster repeller that works in radius x
		- machine supplying infinite resource of x material, placeable
		- 
- multi level belts
